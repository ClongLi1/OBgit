+ pre</br> 17th century 
+ Origins of coffee + The modern version of roasted coffee originated in Arabia. During the 13th century, coffee was extremely popular with the Muslim community for its stimulant powers, which proved useful during long prayer sessions. By parching and boiling the coffee beans, rendering them infertile, the Arabs were able to corner the market on coffee crops. In fact, tradition says that not a single coffee plant existed outside of Arabia or Africa until the 1600s, when Baba Budan, an Indian pilgrim, left Mecca with fertile beans fastened to a strap across his abdomen. Baba’s beans resulted in a new and competitive European coffee trade.

+ Europe and coffee 
+ In 1616, the Dutch founded the first European-owned coffee estate in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, then Java in 1696. The French began growing coffee in the Caribbean, followed by the Spanish in Central America and the Portuguese in Brazil. European coffee houses sprang up in Italy and later France, where they reached a new level of popularity. Now, it is de _rigueur_ for Parisians to indulge in a cup of coffee and a baguette or croissant at the numerous coffee cafes throughout Paris.

title: 咖啡的起源
content:
现代烘焙咖啡起源于阿拉伯。在13世纪，咖啡因的刺激作用使其在穆斯林社区中非常受欢迎，尤其在长时间的祈祷会中非常有用。通过烘烤和煮沸咖啡豆，使其不孕不育，阿拉伯人能够垄断咖啡作物市场。事实上，传统说法是直到17世纪，当印度朝圣者巴巴·布丹将肥沃的咖啡豆系在腹部的带子上离开麦加时，阿拉伯或非洲以外没有一棵咖啡树存在。巴巴的咖啡豆导致了一个新的、有竞争力的欧洲咖啡贸易。

1616年，荷兰人在斯里兰卡（当时是锡兰，后来是爪哇）建立了第一个欧洲人拥有的咖啡庄园。法国人开始在加勒比地区种植咖啡，随后西班牙人在中美洲，葡萄牙人在巴西也开始种植咖啡。欧洲的咖啡馆在意大利和后来的法国兴起，达到了新的流行水平。现在，巴黎人在巴黎各处的咖啡馆里享用一杯咖啡、一根法棍或可颂面包已经成为一种时尚。
